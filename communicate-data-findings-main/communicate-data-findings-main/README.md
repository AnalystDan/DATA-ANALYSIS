## by (Daniel .A. Ogiku)


## Investigation Overview

> In this investigation, I'm interested in the bike trip trends and types of bikers in the bay Area bike sharing system. The main focus was on trip duration, period (weekday, hours), age, gender and user types.

## Dataset Overview

> This document explores the trip data from the Ford GoBike's sharing system for public containing bike rides from February 2019. The attributes included the trip start/end time, as well as additional variabless such as user type, gender, and age.

## Summary of Findings

### 1. ## Distribution of Trip Duration (Minutes)

- The distribution of trip duration is skewed to the left<br>
- The average trip is about 11 minutes, with 75% of trips being under 13 minutes. Looking at the histogram, most rides fall in between the 3 - 15 minute range. <br>
- This implies riders are making more short distance rides.

### 2. Gender Breakdown - Male vs. Female vs. Other

- The visual above demonstrates the overwhelming majority of the bikers are male
- Men account for about 74.4% of the total riders.<br>
- Female riders represents 23.3% of total users
- 'Other' represents the remaining 2.1% 

- Breakdown for member gender from highest to lowest is Male, Female and other <br>
- From the column plot above, Male riders are more than 3x of female riders

### 3. Customers vs. Subscribers Trips Below 60 Years Old

- For a marketing campaign, we can divide the campaign into two (customer vs subscriber). - - From the data above, we can focus on 'Customers' aged 27 - 36 years old.
- Still on the marketing camapign suggestion, For 'Subscribers', we can focus on ages ranging from 24 to 33.
- Customers peaked first at age 30
- Subscriber peaked first at age 25, then peaked again at age 31
- It took up to 12 years for 'Customer' to peak
- While it took just 7 years for 'Subscriber' to peak initially and the second peak came 5 years after the first peak
- For customers, members aged 30 years took the highest number of bike trips
- For subscribers, members aged 31 years took the highest number of bike trips

### 4. Weekdays vs Hours vs User type
